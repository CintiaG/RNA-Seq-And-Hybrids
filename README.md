## Introduction

In this repository I summarize the tools and approaches we have used to analyze RNA-Seq data from hybrids microorganisms. It includes description of the process and scripts to perform the analysis in a personal computer and a cluster.

Current content of this repository:

* **00_rna_seq_intro:** Brief RNA-Seq introduction and isntructions to install used program. Minor troubleshootings.
* **01_rna_seq_data:** Download RNA-Seq information form the NCBI database using the **SRA toolkit**.
